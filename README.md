# 📁 About the Project

This project demonstrates the use of **Laravel 10** features, including **Breeze** for authentication scaffolding.  
It implements core concepts of **Authentication** and **Authorization** in a user-based file management system.

### 🔑 Users can:
- Securely **upload files**
- **View and download public files** shared by others
- Manage **access and permissions** effectively

This setup provides a strong foundation for building secure, user-role-based file systems.
