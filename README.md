# About the Project

This project demonstrates the use of Laravel features, including Breeze for login and registration, and implements core Authentication and Authorization concepts. The application allows users to upload their files securely, as well as view or download public files shared by other users. This setup provides a foundation for managing user access and permissions effectively in a web application.
